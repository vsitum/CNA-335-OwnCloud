Final Project 
                                              Owncloud


In this project I am going to make a Raspberry Pi Owncoud server that can act as my very own personal cloud storage.
I made use of the following equipment for this personal cloud storage setup.
Recommended:
* Raspberry Pi
* SD Card (8GB+) or Micro SD Card if you are using aRpi 2 or B+
* Ethernet Cord or WiFi dongle
* External Hard drive or USB Drive
I have a Raspberry Pi with Raspian (buster) installed. To run the Owncloud software I am going to download a web server (Nginx % PHP) and
add the www-data user to the www-data group. 

After NGINX installation I needed to sett up and configure it, tweak PHP for Owncloud and HTTPS. I used "sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default" 
to configure the web server and restart NGINX. With "sudo nano /etc/php/7.3/fpm/php.ini" I adjust upload_max_filesize and 
post_max_size to 2000M in php.ini file. 
I add swap Memory to Raspberry Pi to work further beyond its memory. By making use of space on the storage device and although it is slower
then RAM it protects from program crashing. "CONF_SWAPSIZE" is modified to 512 in dphys-swapfile file. To set up a MySQL Database (Mariadb) & user
for Owncloud I have to log in to mysql and create database name "ownclouddb" and user "ownclouduser" with password.

 Next step is to change to directory /var/www/ and download the latest version of Owncloud. The permission has to be modified by command 
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www.
Now, .user.ini file has to be modified with upload_max_filesize=2000M, post_max_size=2000M, memory_limit=2000M. 
Mounting & setting up a Drive allows Owncloud to store files onto an external hard drive. After installing NTFS pakage and creating /media/ownclouddrive
we need to get the GID, UID, and the UUID. With these info I will update /etc/fstab file, add line
 "UUID=E025-37D0 /media/ownclouddrive auto nofail,uid=33,gid=33,umask=0027,dmask=0027,noatime 0 0" at the bottom and reboot.

For Setting up Owncloud I found out IP addre s with command uname -I of my Raspberry Pi and type it in browser. After getting Owncloud interface
I had to create Admin account setdata folder /var/www/ownclouddrive and configure the database with database name , user name and password.
To improve my Owncloud software I need to set up Memory Cashing for Owncloud by configuring Owncloud and making use of APCu and Redis. APCu is used as
 an object memory cache, and Redis is used to deal with transactional file locking. By adding 
  'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
  'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
  'redis' => [
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'port' => 6379,
  ],
to the file config.php with command sudo nano /var/www/owncloud/config/config.php I will do it. The Owncloud team recommends that I should 
set System Cron that the operating system runs the scripts cron jobs instead of Ajax. To do it I used command sudo crontab -u www-data -e and add
*  *  *  *  * /usr/bin/php /var/www/owncloud/occ system:cron line to the file bottom.

To have access to my cloud drive outside my local network (cloud on the go) I will need to setup port forwarding and make a few changes to the config files. 
I have to be sure when setting up the external port that it isnâ€™t already reserved for a specific program.
